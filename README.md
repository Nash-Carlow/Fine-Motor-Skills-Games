# Fine-Motor-Skills-Games
This project was developed to help those who are struggling with developing or redeveloping their fine-motor skills. In this website, my team and I created different games using the JavaScript library, p5js. These games each focused on different motor functions to help reinforce and build muscles in the hands.
